Its really irksome when your compiler
complains for any unmatched "{" or "(" or "[".
With this plugin you can highlight all
those unmatched "{" or "("  or  "[" as you type.
This helps you to keep track of where
the exact closing bracket should come.

This plugin also warns you of any extra "}" or ")" or "]" you typed.

Customization:   
		   - Specifying Additional Bracket-pairs.
         		   	  User can specify additional matching pairs in
                     the global option 'matchpairs', see :help 'matchpairs'
                     For eg: set mps+=<:> (to include <> pair)
                     put the above setting in .vimrc file and restart vim.
                  - To get rid of highlighting when you quit insert
                     mode, add this mapping in your vimrc
                           noremap! <Esc> <Esc>:match NONE<CR>

To test how this plugin works type something like
{
  (     ) [ ]
  ( ( ( ) ) )
}

Happy vimming.
